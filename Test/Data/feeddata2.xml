				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Welcome to the final step in our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/creating-a-pln/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free professional learning series</a> on building your PLN.</p>
<p>Now you know what a PLN is, and how people build one, we&#8217;re going to discuss ways of making time for your PLN.</p>
<p>In this step you will explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to find time to develop your PLN and embed simple practices into your routine</li>
<li>Tips for building your PLN</li>
</ol>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Throughout this series, we&#8217;ve looked at different ways that educators enjoy building a PLN and connecting with their networks.</p>
<p>While we mainly focused on Twitter, blogs, and curation tools, remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There are many other ways that educators connect with others and we encourage you to explore anything that looks interesting to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Popular-ways-educators-are-learning-with-their-PLN-2hzwjdz-1mgvor3.png"><img class="wp-image-5190 alignnone" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Popular-ways-educators-are-learning-with-their-PLN-2hzwjdz-1mgvor3.png" alt="Popular ways educators are learning with their PLN Edublogs Teacher Challenge" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Popular-ways-educators-are-learning-with-their-PLN-2hzwjdz-1mgvor3.png 800w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Popular-ways-educators-are-learning-with-their-PLN-2hzwjdz-1mgvor3-150x150.png 150w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Popular-ways-educators-are-learning-with-their-PLN-2hzwjdz-1mgvor3-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Whatever tools you use, you want it to be sustainable. The real benefits of having a PLN emerge once you get to know people and as we&#8217;ve said throughout this series, the more you put in, the more you&#8217;ll get back.</p>
<h3>Tips For Building Your PLN</h3>
<p>Here are some tips for building your PLN and making the time to be a &#8216;connected educator&#8217; without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<h4>Do what works best for you</h4>
<p>How do you like to learn and connect best? Do you prefer reading and text based materials? Are you a keen writer? Maybe you like audio and enjoy learning via podcasts. Videos are also a popular way for people to learn and share information.</p>
<p>Follow your natural learning style and think about ways you can become a connected educator by doing what you&#8217;re comfortable with. Not every tool or service is for everyone!</p>
<h4>Start small</h4>
<p>Put your blinkers on. You really don&#8217;t need to use all the tools that are out there. Trying to keep up with many people and many tools is a recipe for feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Some educators have built up a great network just by reading a handful of blogs and following a small number of people on Twitter. Remember, it&#8217;s quality over quantity.</p>
<h4>Set a goal and commit</h4>
<p>Set yourself one goal of something you&#8217;re going to commit to trying.</p>
<p>Maybe your goal will be to join Twitter and find 10 people to follow. Then challenge yourself to check in every day for a month and see what your followers are tweeting about. If this works for you, you can build on it. If not, you can always try something new!</p>
<h4>Set a routine</h4>
<p>You probably already have a number of online routines in place. Maybe you&#8217;re in the routine of checking your emails in the morning, or perhaps browsing Facebook when you sit down after dinner.</p>
<p>Create a routine for your PLN too.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to involve a big chunk of time. A few minutes here and there to read a blog post, browse through Feedly or Flipboard, or scroll through Twitter can be all you need to get on your way.</p>
<h4>Consider becoming more productive</h4>
<p>We all know how easy it is for time to whittle away while browsing online. Whether it&#8217;s YouTube videos or Instagram photos, maybe some of your online browsing experiences can be redirected to building your PLN.</p>
<p>Of course, we all need downtime but this is something for you to ponder!</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t be shy</h4>
<p>Most people in the educational community are remarkably friendly. Don&#8217;t be shy about following people you don&#8217;t know, leaving a stranger a comment, or responding to someone&#8217;s tweet.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably be glad you did and you never know where one small interaction can take you!</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t give up</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s so common to try something new and feel a great sense of discomfort. You might feel confused and overwhelmed but don&#8217;t give up! Once you get over the initial learning curve, it will all pay off. We promise!</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll end up like <a href="https://twitter.com/TxTechChick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tisha Poncio</a> who gave this inspiring shout out to her PLN on Twitter.</p>

				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Welcome to the sixth and penultimate step in our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/creating-a-pln/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free professional learning series</a> on building your PLN.</p>

<li>A range of different tools that you can choose from to make content curation easier.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Is Content Curation?</h3>
<p>We are living in an era of information overload. There is so much content shared online that we actively seek out people who have good content curation skills to help us &#8220;sort the wheat from the chaff&#8221;.</p>
<p>A person with good curation skills saves us time by sifting through the vast abundance of content on the internet to select the best, most relevant resources on a specific topic or theme. The curator organizes, manages, and collates for their own use and shares with us.</p>
<p>If you look closely at most educators with a high following on social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, or Instagram you&#8217;ll notice that most are great content curators and share excellent resources.</p>
<p>Their sharing and content curation skills helped them build their PLN.</p>

<h4>Video: What Is Content Creation?</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://youtu.be/8Qzgj7Mk8As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 second video</a> provides a useful overview of content creation.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Qzgj7Mk8As?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>21st Century Content Curation</h3>
<p>Of course, content curation is nothing new. It has been an important skill for hundreds of years &#8212; think of newspapers, art galleries, museums, or simple storytelling.</p>
<p>Teachers have always been curators too &#8212; bringing together the most worthwhile materials to help their students learn. In the past, this might have been limited to books, posters, concrete materials, guest speakers, etc. But of course, there are so many wonderful digital resources available now too.</p>
<p>Content curation has been happening since the beginning of time in some form or another; however, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly worthwhile and complex as the volume of information online continues to increase.</p>
<p>21st century content curation can involve finding, verifying, organizing, annotating, remixing, creating, collating, and sharing.</p>
<p>This might sound overwhelming but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Luckily, there are some excellent free digital tools for content curation which we&#8217;ll explore in this post.</p>
<h3>The Benefits Of Content Curation</h3>
<p>The main reasons why educators curate content include:</p>
<ol>
<li>To find, organize, and manage information and resources on specific topics.</li>
<li>To stay informed about the latest information on specific topics which leads to professional growth.</li>
<li>To learn through the process. As you search for and curate the best resources, you reflect on their value and you may develop new ways of thinking.</li>
<li>To help build their PLN. Networks actively seek and follow good content curators because they save us time.</li>
<li>To learn how to curate themselves so they can teach students how to curate content for research, their interests, and passions. Curation is an important part of being digitally literate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn more about students as content curators in this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c01GXu8S520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video by John Spencer</a>.</p>

<h3>The Curation Process</h3>
<p>We made this diagram to simplify the process of content curation. Feel free to use it on your blog or share with others.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Basics-Of-Content-Curation-Edublogs-PLN-Teacher-Challenge-254ao1b-vwt00l.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5263" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Basics-Of-Content-Curation-Edublogs-PLN-Teacher-Challenge-254ao1b-vwt00l.png" alt="Read, Editorialize, Share -- The Basics Of Content Curation Edublogs PLN Teacher Challenge " width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Basics-Of-Content-Curation-Edublogs-PLN-Teacher-Challenge-254ao1b-vwt00l.png 1024w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Basics-Of-Content-Curation-Edublogs-PLN-Teacher-Challenge-254ao1b-vwt00l-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1) Read</strong> &#8212; Visit your favorite blogs or social media accounts, use curation tools like Flipboard or Feedly, or perhaps subscribe to newsletters. This consumption might mostly include text-based materials but don&#8217;t forget podcasts and videos too.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>FILTER</strong> </span>&#8212; Before moving on to the next step, you need to filter. You do not just want to share anything and everything. Check out <a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/curator-or-dumper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Are You a Curator or a Dumper?</a> by Jennifer Gonzalez. You also need to verify and make sure you don&#8217;t share anything that might not be true.</p>
<p><strong>2) Editorialize</strong> &#8212; Here is where you need to add your own touches to your findings to help others. This involves considering your audience and what they might be interested in. You might even put together a few similar resources that complement or contrast each other.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>CREATE</strong> </span>&#8212; Before sharing, you might consider if you could create something with the content. This could be putting your favorite quote on a graphic to make your findings more shareable. Or maybe you could make your own infographic to share based on your findings.</p>
<p><strong>3) Share</strong> &#8212; As we&#8217;re discovering throughout this PLN series, you can share with your PLN in a wide range of ways. Commonly, teachers will share with their network via their blog or social media. Sometimes you might want to compile resources together into one location using a tool like Wakelet, Google Docs, or Padlet. Once you share, be willing to interact with your PLN. Invite them to comment by asking questions and don&#8217;t forget to reply to any comments. Needless to say, when you&#8217;re sharing other people&#8217;s work, you should make it clear where it&#8217;s from.</p>
<p><em>Note: we&#8217;ll be explaining the tools mentioned above further on in this post. </em></p>
<h3>Examples Of Shared Content On Twitter</h3>
<p>Content curation is not just finding a link and putting it in a tweet. Your PLN is not going to get much value out of that.</p>
<p>As the curator, you can challenge yourself to do a little more from time to time.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of curated work from educators.</p>
<p><a href="https://learninginhand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Vincent</a> is well known for his graphics he creates for social media. These are always shared extensively.</p>

<h3>Digital Curation Tools</h3>
<p>There are a plethora of free digital tools you can use to help with content curation.</p>
<p>Tools generally fall into one of these three categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>News discovery tools</strong> &#8212; Use your preferred news discovery tool to select and aggregate the content. News discovery tools save time by feeding you the most relevant content. Examples of news discovery tools include Feedly, Flipboard, Nuzzle, and following a hashtag on Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Curation tools</strong> &#8212; Use your preferred curation tools to display your content with context, organization, annotation, and presentation. Examples of curation tools include Scoop.IT, Flipboard, Diigo, Wakelet, LiveBinder, or a blog.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing tools</strong> &#8212; Select which networks you share your curated content on. For example, you might share the content on Twitter and Facebook. Some people will choose to follow your curated content via your curation tools (such as follow you on Scoop.IT, Pinterest, Flipboard Magazine, or Diigo).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overview Of Popular Curation Tools</h4>
<p>Which tools you use, and how you curate, is very personal.</p>
<p>You might have a set workflow that you follow regularly, or you might dip in and out of using different tools depending on your mood and needs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll now provide a snapshot of how some of the more popular curation tools work. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Wakelet</li>
<li>Nuzzel</li>
<li>Pocket</li>
<li>Diigo</li>
<li>Evernote</li>
<li>Flipboard</li>
<li>LiveBinders</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>Scoop.it</li>
</ul>
<h4>Blogs</h4>
<p>Blogs posts are a popular way of curating content because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can dive deeper and write a detailed elaboration. You may find that the act of writing helps to transform your vague ideas into well structured thoughts.</li>
<li>You can customize and organize vast amounts of information in meaningful ways.</li>
<li>You might write a post about a single article you&#8217;ve read, or create a round-up post. This is where you share links to great content from multiple sources about a specific topic. Ideally, you&#8217;d add your own short annotations too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Silvia Tolisano&#8217;s post on <a href="http://langwitches.org/blog/2014/06/15/blogging-as-a-curation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogging as a curation platform</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Check out these examples of educators who curate content using blogs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larry Ferlazzo finds and shares the latest news of a range of educational topics on <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/">Larry Ferlazzo&#8217;s Websites of the Day</a> as well as curating resources into <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/about/my-best-of-series/">his &#8216;Best of&#8217; lists</a>.</li>
<li>Doug Pete publishes a weekly round up of <a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/?s=%22This+Week+in+Ontario+Edublogs%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts that caught his eye on Ontario Edublogs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freetech4teachers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Byrne</a> curates content on a daily basis on his blog. He adds his own insights, summaries, or how-to videos to help his audience. For example, when there was <a href="https://www.freetech4teachers.com/2018/07/the-new-gmail-is-coming-soon-to-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news about Gmail</a>, he summarized this information and added a &#8216;What does this mean for teachers?&#8217; annotation.</li>

<p>When you sign up for a free Nuzzel account you can get a curated email sent to you daily with the top stories from the people you follow.</p>
<p>This is really handy to stay abreast of important stories. You can then explore those links and decide whether they&#8217;re worth sharing with your PLN.</p>
<p>With Nuzzel, you can curate your own newsletter for your followers too. You can include stories you find interesting and add a personal touch with a headline and comments.</p>
<p>Your PLN can subscribe to your newsletter and you can share it on social media like <a href="https://twitter.com/hickstro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hicks</a> has done here.</p>

<h4>Pocket</h4>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re browsing the web or social media and you come across an interesting article, video, or link. You&#8217;d like to read it but you might be short on time.</p>

<p>You can save directly from your browser or from apps like Twitter, Feedly, or Flipboard. You can view it again when you&#8217;re ready &#8212; from your computer, phone, or tablet. You can even view the item when you&#8217;re offline.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve reviewed the items you&#8217;ve saved, you can then decided if there are any you&#8217;d like to share with your PLN.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: While there are still many teachers who enjoy using Evernote, <a href="https://www.freetech4teachers.com/2016/07/evernotes-free-plan-is-almost-worthless.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes to the free plan in 2016</a> resulted in some educators switching to other options. </em></p>
<h4>Flipboard</h4>
<p><a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> was originally designed as a social network aggregation, magazine-format app for iPad in 2010. It&#8217;s now the most popular of the magazine-like content aggregation apps.</p>
<p>Flipboard’s strength is you are able to bring your social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn into one location alongside your favorite news sources and anything else you like to read, or watch (like YouTube). On top of this, it&#8217;s easy to share your favorite content with your social networks and easy to curate your favorite content into Flipboard magazine(s).</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4VgKTGsqcY?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Flipboard is a powerful tool for curating your favorite content into magazine(s).</p>
<p>The benefits of using a Flipboard magazine include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quickly curating and sharing articles you like directly to your own magazine from within Flipboard (or using the <a href="https://share.flipboard.com/">Flip It bookmarklet</a> in your web browser), while also sharing the articles with your social networks at the same time!</li>
<li>Other Flipboard users can subscribe to your Flipboard magazine(s) allowing them to easily read the articles you like to share.</li>
<li>Anyone who clicks on a link can read your magazine using their web browser regardless of whether or not they have a Flipboard account.</li>
</ol>

<p>You add items to your Pinterest accounts using pins. A pin is a visual bookmark which could be an image, video, slideshare, or a web clip of a site.</p>
<p>When you click on a pin it takes you to the site where the pin was sourced from so you can learn more.</p>
<p>Some people think of Pinterest as a social media platform but it&#8217;s really more like a search engine. Pinterest <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/guide/all-about-pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls itself</a> a visual discovery engine.</p>

<h4>Scoop.it</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.scoop.it/">Scoop.it</a> allows you to create a web page to share what you find interesting with the world.</p>
<p>It does this combining clever curation tools that make it easy to gather content in one place with a wide range of sharing functionalities to let people know about your Scoop.it page.</p>

<h3>Curation Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Kay Oddone created <a href="https://linkinglearning.wordpress.com/2015/03/06/digital-content-curation-a-vital-strategy-for-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this diagram</a> based on a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/catspyjamas/when-educators-become-curators-keynote-slides-moothr12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation </a>by Joyce Seitzinger.</p>
<p>It summarizes some of the pitfalls you want to avoid as a content curator.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Hoarder: a curator who collects everything indiscriminately, who doesn’t organise their content, and doesn’t share – this is really closer to simple aggregation than curation.</p>
<p>The Scrooge: one who, similarly hoards their information – although they may organise their collection, they don’t share either; one of the key purposes of educational content curation!</p>
<p>The Tabloid (or National Enquirer): a collector who indiscriminately collates everything together, and generously shares this aggregation, whether others want/need it or not!</p>
<p>The Robot: a curator who uses tools to shares automatically, with no context related additions or value adding; in this case, the curation is really no better than providing a list of Google search results.</p>
<p>Avoiding these pitfalls is what differentiates the effective content curator from those simply ‘collecting’ content.</p></blockquote>
<p>Visit <a href="https://linkinglearning.wordpress.com/2015/03/06/digital-content-curation-a-vital-strategy-for-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kay&#8217;s post</a> to learn more about content curation.</p>
<h3>Create Your Own Workflow</h3>
<p>Remember, while there are tools that can help with the aggregation and organization of all the great resources you&#8217;re coming across, technology can&#8217;t do the curation. This is the job for a human who knows their audience (their PLN).</p>
<p>We encourage you to try out the following process if you&#8217;re ready to give content curation a go:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the tool(s) that you prefer to use for news discovery, for curation, and for sharing.</li>
<li>Curate the content that helps you, and is helpful for others.</li>
<li>Make it part of your routine to curate and share content.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you get going and try different tools, your wants and needs might evolve. You&#8217;ll figure out the pros and cons of different tools as you use them.</p>
<p>Stick with it and you&#8217;ll begin to develop your own workflow that works for you!</p>
<h4>Want to see an example of a workflow?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.freetech4teachers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Byrne</a> is a master curator, keeping hundreds of thousands of teachers in the loop on a daily basis. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqs8BhavZDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch </a>how he uses Feedly and Google Keep together.</p>

				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Welcome to the fifth step in our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/creating-a-pln/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free professional learning series</a> on building your PLN.</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain what a blog is.</li>
<li>Unpack the benefits of using blogs as part of your PLN.</li>
<li>Describe some of the ways people keep up to date with blogs.</li>
<li>Explore how to use blogs as part of your PLN.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blogs play an important role in most educators&#8217; PLNs and making blogs part of your PLN is more than just publishing posts on your own blog. If you don&#8217;t see yourself setting up your own blog, there are many benefits to simply reading, commenting, and sharing other people&#8217;s blogs.</p>
<h3>What Is A Blog?</h3>
<p>Blogs have been mainstream for well over a decade, so you might be very familiar with what a blog is (you&#8217;re reading a blog right now!).</p>
<p>However, let’s take a moment to define what exactly a blog is as the term continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Over recent year, the lines between blogs, websites, ePortfolios, and other online spaces have been blurring.</p>
<table style="height: 211px;" width="724">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>BLOG</th>
<th>WEBSITE</th>
<th>PORTFOLIO</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback and interaction (comments, sharing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSS, and subscription)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically journal-like</span></td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Static i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nformation </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General term for online space &#8212; complex or simple</span></td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaffolding, showcasing or organization of student work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically over a period of time (years)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blog is simply a website, although traditionally a website will have been more of a static space.</p>
<p>What makes a blog different than a simple website?</p>
<ul>
<li>A blog traditionally would be updated fairly regularly and display posts in reverse chronological order.</li>
<li>Comments have always been a key feature of blogs, providing an interactive space.</li>
<li>Most blogs have pages where some key information is housed that isn&#8217;t updated very frequently (for example, an About Me page).</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, some people have a website that has a blog component; the home page doesn&#8217;t change but readers can click on a tab to view a regularly updated blog.</p>
<p>An example of this is <a href="http://www.langwitches.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Langwitches&#8217; &#8220;Online Hub&#8221;</a>. This is a website that displays Silvia Tolisano&#8217;s professional portfolio and there is a blog section that readers can navigate to from the front page.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Langwitches-Online-Hub-28geh6i-qslzpq.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5248" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Langwitches-Online-Hub-28geh6i-qslzpq.png" alt="Langwtiches Online Hub" width="972" height="339" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Langwitches-Online-Hub-28geh6i-qslzpq.png 972w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Langwitches-Online-Hub-28geh6i-qslzpq-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /></a></p>
<h4>An Introduction To Blogging Video</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDxg5ODEXEQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video </a>also provides a simple overview of what a blog is.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDxg5ODEXEQ?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Reasons Why Educators Blog</h3>
<p>The main reasons why educators have personal/professional blogs include to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share information and tips with other educators.</li>
<li>Collaborate with a global audience. Increased collaboration with others leads to greater innovation and new perspectives.</li>
<li>Reflect on their learning or their teaching/work practices.</li>
<li>Learn how to blog themselves so they can use blogs effectively with their students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.theedublogger.com/survey-2017-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The State of Educational blogging in 2017/2018</a> for more information on why educators use blogs.</p>
<p>Your personal blog extends your relationships outside of your school and allows you to connect with global educators who all willingly help each other.</p>
<h3>Using Blogs As Part Of Your PLN</h3>
<p>Sue Waters, who is the backbone of Edublogs has reflected on her own experiences of blogging.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m sure that lots of people would be totally surprised by the fact that initially I really struggled with the concept of blogging — <em>&#8216;Why would anyone blog and why would anyone read their blogs?&#8217;</em></p>
<p>It took almost a year from being shown what a blog was to becoming a blogger.</p>
<p>The online tools I used before blogging were excellent for sharing information. But blogging gave me what they lacked; the ability to reflect, collaborate, exchange ideas, and connect with other people.</p>
<p>Ultimately, blogging completely changed my life; it&#8217;s the reason why I&#8217;m now employed to do the work I do and blogging helped me build a strong PLN.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that not everyone who makes blogs part of their PLN are bloggers themselves. It&#8217;s really up to you!</p>
<p>Some educators prefer to read and comment on other people&#8217;s posts while other educators also have their own personal blog.</p>
<p>If you have a vague thought in the back of your mind about starting your own blog but you&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s for you, hopefully Sue&#8217;s words above remind you that you can jump into blogging with some reluctance and you may be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>What have you got to lose?</p>
<h3>Tips For Building Your PLN Via Blogs</h3>
<p>The key components to making blogs part of your PLN are really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and comment on other people&#8217;s blog posts. Then share anything that resonates with you with your PLN (e.g. on Twitter).</li>
<li>Publish posts on your own blog to reflect your thoughts, ideas, and/or to share resources. Remember, this is optional but keep it in mind!</li>
</ul>
<p>Like everything, there are tips that&#8217;ll both save you time and make you more effective.</p>
<h4>Reading Blog Posts</h4>
<p>There are thousands of educators out there who are regularly publishing on their own blogs. Many of these blogs revolve around specific topics, interests, or subjects areas. Others are more general reflections on all areas of education.</p>
<p>Reading blog posts is an important part of connecting with other educators. But how do you keep up to date with your favorite blogs and know if something new has been published?</p>
<p>There are three main ways you can keep up with your favorite blogs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email subscription or email newsletter if available</li>
<li>RSS feed (using a tool like Feedly)</li>
<li>Social media and curation tools like Flipboard</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, when we did a quick poll of our Edublogs community in July 2018, 61% of respondents indicated that their favorite way to keep up to date with the blogs they like to read is via social media.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Voting-following-blogs-11y5l4y-2jx4unr.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5440" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Voting-following-blogs-11y5l4y-2jx4unr.png" alt="Poll showing 61% people keep up to date with blogs via social media" width="393" height="147" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Voting-following-blogs-11y5l4y-2jx4unr.png 393w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Voting-following-blogs-11y5l4y-2jx4unr-300x112.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></a></p>
<p>This might demonstrate that people are okay with consuming information serendipitously (there&#8217;s no guarantees they&#8217;ll see posts on social media). To avoid being swamped by emails, perhaps people choose to subscribe to only their very favorite blogs in this way. Feel free to tell us what you think in the comments!</p>
<h5>Email Subscription</h5>
<p>Many bloggers have an option to be notified via email when they publish something new. This might be via a simple email subscription widget on the sidebar of their blog. In this case, you&#8217;ll receive an email automatically to alert you to new posts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also becoming more common to see educators (and bloggers in general) create their own personal email newsletter to keep readers up to date. This might be sent out every time they publish something new, or there might be a weekly or monthly summary email.</p>
<p>Check out the sidebar of your favorite blog and look for a sign-up box.</p>
<h5>RSS Feed (Feedly)</h5>
<p>One of the easiest ways to keep updated with posts from your favorite blogs is to subscribe to their RSS feed using <a href="https://feedly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly. </a>The free version of Feedly allows you to follow up to 100 sources which should be enough to keep you busy!</p>
<p>Refer to these<a href="http://help.edublogs.org/introduction-to-rss-and-subscribing-using-rss/"> step-by-step instructions on how to set up Feedly.</a></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCqgihslEJU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video</a> by Joshua Essary explains how to get started with Feedly.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCqgihslEJU?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>There are other similar tools, but Feedly is one of the most popular.</p>
<p>Here are just a few popular education blogs you can subscribe to using Feedly.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xkY7I7GQlVziVxgCp3aVFwAFeCzHOJIBGmf0FsTfUN4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to open this spreadsheet in a new window.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTfrVIF3lxzRJVsINt-HMCSlD9hTbHpl1rEyQTSgR7EMkyUh01FXAsqEyXrXrD1XcyRfXpNefW7LuND/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="720" height="360"></iframe></p>
<h5>Social Media And Flipboard</h5>
<p>If you follow your favorite bloggers on Twitter, no doubt you will see them announcing when they have something new on their blog. Of course, there are no guarantees that you will always see this.</p>
<p>Another option Sue Waters uses on her mobile devices is subscribing to her Twitter timeline and Twitter hashtags using <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>.</p>
<p>This pulls all the links shared on Twitter into her Flipboard account in a magazine format where it&#8217;s easy to read, share, and comment on articles shared by her network.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find detailed <a href="http://theedublogger.com/2013/06/12/flipboard/">step by step instructions on how to set up Flipboard here</a>.</p>
<p>Watch this video to see <a href="http://youtu.be/ARcLfnaNuFM">how Sue uses Flipboard</a>.</p>

<h4>Commenting On Posts</h4>
<p>Your commenting skills and how you engage in comments with others on blogs posts is one of the most important, and often overlooked, aspects of using blogs as part of your PLN.</p>
<p>The comment section is where the deep learning, questioning, and reflection can occur. Comments turn your blog from a static space into an interactive conversation.</p>
<h5>Commenting Tips For Bloggers</h5>
<p><strong>1.  Don&#8217;t just lurk &#8212; comment!</strong></p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;re probably not going to comment on every blog post you read, but every now and then make the concerted effort to scroll down to that comment box and type a response, ask a question, or share your own insights. Your comments don&#8217;t have to be long to make an impact.</p>
<p>Remember, being part of a PLN is about giving as well as receiving. Taking the time to begin conversations will pay off!</p>
<p><strong>2. Approve comments quickly</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a blogger and someone leaves a comment on your post, make sure you <a href="http://help.edublogs.org/2009/08/01/managing-and-approving-comments/">approve the comment quickly</a> (if you moderate comments).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing more annoying to a reader to see that their comments haven&#8217;t been published. They might forget about it and not check back to see your response.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Always respond back to readers on your own posts</strong></p>
<p>If readers have made time to comment on your posts <strong>the very minimum you should do is respond back to your readers</strong> (ideally each reader) in the comments on your post.</p>
<p>This is very important for building your blog’s community; it demonstrates that you value your readers and their input.</p>
<p>Below is an example of replying back to a comment using threaded comments:</p>
<p><img src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/comments62-16e2b5v.png" alt="Comment on a post" width="650" height="550" /></p>
<p><strong>4.  Use the Subscribe to Comments option</strong></p>
<p>If a blogger provides a subscribe to comment option, then make sure you select this option when leaving a comment, so you&#8217;re notified by email of any follow up comments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll make your life easier. 🙂</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3868" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2011/07/comments61-njry6q.png" alt="Notify of follow up comments" width="650" height="290" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2011/07/comments61-njry6q.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2011/07/comments61-njry6q-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h3>Set Up Your Own Blog</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never blogged before, hopefully you&#8217;re reading this with the open mind to consider starting a blog now or even in the future.</p>
<h4>But there are so many blogs out there! Why should I start one?</h4>
<p>This is a common concern for people contemplating whether to start their own blog. They might feel like there is so much noise and so many blogs that are already established. They wonder what they could possibly have to add to the community?</p>
<p>We can assure you, you do have something worthwhile to share!</p>
<p>You are the only you. Your unique perspectives could be exactly what someone else needs to hear.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/7013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Couros</a> has said,</p>
<blockquote><p>My best advice…write for you and don’t overthink. See every blog post as a rough draft to something you are building over time, not a college term paper.</p>
<p>The more you do it, the better you will become.</p>
<p>The better you become, the easier it will be.</p>
<p>Be kind, be thoughtful, but don’t overthink. It is probably holding you back for inspiring someone else, and probably surprising yourself.</p></blockquote>

<h4>A Blog Is Your Online Home</h4>
<p>There are many advantages to blogging.</p>
<p>George Couros&#8217; <a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/7909" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three reasons for blogging</a> are shared by thousands of educators worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/George-Couros-Reasons-I-Blog-1nr9rjw-21s41g1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5251" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/George-Couros-Reasons-I-Blog-1nr9rjw-21s41g1.png" alt="Reasons George Couros Blogs To share my thinking. To develop my thinking. To archive my thinking." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/George-Couros-Reasons-I-Blog-1nr9rjw-21s41g1.png 1024w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/George-Couros-Reasons-I-Blog-1nr9rjw-21s41g1-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the great advantages of having your own blog when you&#8217;re setting up your PLN, is that it&#8217;s your online home.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll discover a really cool tool, article, or resource. You could write about it (and share your learning with others).</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll connect with some like minded teachers and possibly start some sort of collaboration. This would be perfect to blog about.</p>
<p>Even if your blog doesn&#8217;t really have an audience, a blog can be a fantastic place to keep track of all the work you&#8217;re doing both online and offline.</p>
<p>Your blog can also become an excellent professional portfolio. This can be an advantage when you&#8217;re trying to demonstrate who you are and what you&#8217;re passionate about for future career opportunities.</p>
<p>As Stephanie Thompson pointed out <a href="https://traintheteacher.me/2014/04/28/10-things-i-learned-from-10-years-of-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her blog, </a></p>
<blockquote><p>An effective personal learning network and a willingness to share has enabled me to enjoy some incredible learning opportunities both inside and outside the classroom in the last few years. When I look back, even getting that <a href="https://traintheteacher.me/2011/09/29/how-twitter-helped-me-land-my-first-teaching-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first job offer</a> in a market <a href="https://traintheteacher.me/2012/05/17/too-many-teachers-not-enough-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saturated with teaching graduates</a> was directly attributable to an online professional presence.</p></blockquote>
<h4>What Platform Should I Blog On?</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re still reading, hopefully you&#8217;re thinking that setting up a blog is a possibility.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering where to set up your blog?</p>

<h3>Conclusion: Why Blog When You Can Microblog?</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot you can learn from getting involved in the blogging community whether that&#8217;s writing your own posts, or simply reading and commenting on other blogs.</p>
<p>However, this takes a certain amount of time. So what is the benefit of using blogs as a part of your PLN, as opposed to a tool like Twitter or other forms of social media?</p>
<p>Simply put, the more you put in the more you get out. Blogging allows you to dig deeper and really form strong connections with others. You&#8217;re not limited to 280 characters like on Twitter. You can write thousands of words if you like! Or at other times a few short sentences might suffice. The choice is powerful.</p>
<p>Tom Barrett created the following diagram for a <a href="http://edte.ch/blog/2015/02/16/micro-engagement-is-killing-our-edublogging-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post where he explored the impact of microblogging.</a></p>
<figure id="attachment_5249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5249" style="width: 998px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Tom-Barrett-Microblogging-zmd1ce-268yr2o.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5249 size-full" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Tom-Barrett-Microblogging-zmd1ce-268yr2o.jpg" alt="Tom Barrett Microblogging" width="998" height="643" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Tom-Barrett-Microblogging-zmd1ce-268yr2o.jpg 998w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Tom-Barrett-Microblogging-zmd1ce-268yr2o-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5249" class="wp-caption-text">Image by Tom Barrett</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tom Barrett <a href="http://edte.ch/blog/2015/02/16/micro-engagement-is-killing-our-edublogging-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>There is nothing wrong with the amber lit retweeting and sharing, but for many people we are sharing in an attempt to have the most impact on others. The micro engagement that occurs as people share without reading and, reposting content without engaging any further, is much more prevalent than the more in depth discussions of 10 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s definitely room for the amber, but think about the benefits that the green could bring to your professional life too.</p>
<p>Like all other aspects of building a PLN &#8212; what you get back is directly related to what you put in!</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://edtechreview.edtechreview.info/news/757-blogs-an-important-part-of-your-pln" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article for EdTech Review</a>, Saomya Saxena explained how blogs are an essential part of an educator&#8217;s PLN,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hence, blogs are one of the most significant online tools that can help you build your professional and personal learning networks. There’s no limit to the people we can connect with, be inspired by and stretch our professional wings with and blogging offers a great opportunity to do that. I feel that, blogs will be a must for anyone who wants to develop a PLN for himself, since it is the most open, creative and free way of sharing knowledge and expressing oneself. So embrace blogging in your daily lives and grow your learning networks personally as well as professionally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Definitely food for thought.</p>

				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Welcome to the fourth step in our free <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/creating-a-pln/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional learning series</a> on building your PLN.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous step,</a> we introduced you to Twitter and explained how people use it to build their PLN.</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain what hashtags and Twitter chats are.</li>
<li>Explain the benefits of participating in Twitter Chats with your PLN.</li>
<li>Provide tips for getting the most out of Twitter Chats</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Are Hashtags?</h3>
<p>Before we begin explaining Twitter chats, we should break down hashtags which are an important part of Twitter.</p>
<p>A hashtag is written with the “#” hash (pound) sign and is used to index keywords or topics on Twitter.</p>
<p>Putting a hashtag symbol (#) in front of a relevant keyword or phrase helps to categorize the tweet and make it easier for people to find.</p>
<p>Hashtags can be used anywhere in a tweet. They can replace a word as demonstrated below, or just be tacked on to the end of a tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Have you ever tried creating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/podcasts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#podcasts</a> with your students? It&#8217;s easier than you might think. Check out our Edublogger&#8217;s guide to podcasting to go through all the basics! <a href="https://t.co/11Kf0QZG6B">https://t.co/11Kf0QZG6B</a> <a href="https://t.co/JXIS2sVbNV">pic.twitter.com/JXIS2sVbNV</a></p>
<p>— edublogs (@edublogs) <a href="https://twitter.com/edublogs/status/1013104899259863044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When you click on the hashtagged word or phrase (e.g. #podcasts) a new page will load with tweets from everyone who is tweeting about podcasts &#8212; whether or not you follow those people.</p>
<p>Note that hashtags can&#8217;t have any spaces so <em>math chat</em> becomes <em>#mathchat. </em></p>
<h4>What Hashtag Should I Use?</h4>
<p>You can use any hashtag you like, however, if it&#8217;s not being used by others then people won&#8217;t be following it or searching for it. So to get the most out of hashtags, you should usually use ones that others are using.</p>
<p>Note that hashtags are not created by Twitter, but by Twitter users. Often if there is an event going on, the organizers will publish the official hashtag on the conference materials and social media.</p>
<p>For example, when ISTE 2018 was happening, ISTE tweeted out the official hashtag:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Are you following the official hashtag for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISTE18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ISTE18</a>? Watch for behind the scenes content, tag your posts to share YOUR learning journey and find new connections! <a href="https://t.co/V8UnYN2Wsu">pic.twitter.com/V8UnYN2Wsu</a></p>
<p>— ISTE (@iste) <a href="https://twitter.com/iste/status/1010210782804676608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h4>Following Hashtags</h4>
<p>You can type a hashtagged keyword in the search bar on Twitter to discover tweets and accounts based on your interests. There are easier ways to follow hashtags so you don&#8217;t have to keep running the same search.</p>
<p><a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TweetDeck</a> is commonly used to follow hashtags that you want to keep track of regularly (the Twitter search bar is fine if you just want to do one-off searches).</p>
<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e77bbJUrlrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video by Jennifer Fox</a> to find out how to set up TweetDeck to follow hashtags.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e77bbJUrlrc?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Starting Your Own Hashtag</h4>
<p>Hashtags are community driven and anyone can start one. Maybe you want to start your own hashtag with a group of people from your PLN who have a similar interest.</p>
<p>Say you&#8217;ve been talking to a group of teachers about using greenscreen technology and you thought you could use the hashtag #greenscreen101 to keep the conversations going.</p>
<p>To avoid using a hashtag that is already being used, it&#8217;s advisable to search for that hashtag first. Things can get confusing if your hashtag is being used by another group!</p>
<p>Simply search in the Twitter search box for your preferred hashtag or use a free tool like <a href="https://hashtagify.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashtagify.me</a>.</p>
<p>Here I can see that #greenscreen101 hasn&#8217;t be tweeted in a number of years, so it would be fine to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/greenscreen-101-2lv1yie-2b9chpp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5214" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/greenscreen-101-2lv1yie-2b9chpp.png" alt="Twitter search for #greenscreen101 Edublogs" width="600" height="420" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/greenscreen-101-2lv1yie-2b9chpp.png 892w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/greenscreen-101-2lv1yie-2b9chpp-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h5>Fun Idea: Use Your Own Hashtag To Find Your Tweets</h5>
<p>Kathleen Sokolowski has shared a handy tip about creating your own personal hashtag in order to find tweets that you want to remember or come back to.</p>
<p>Read all about it in <a href="https://twowritingteachers.org/2018/08/22/quick-twitter-tip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her article on creating a Twitter Digital Notebook. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>If you are like me and frequently read articles and posts that resonate, challenge you or speak to you in some way, consider creating a hashtag for yourself! When you want to find your tweet again, just search for your hashtag in the search bar and be sure to click “Latest” to see all your tweets.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Finding Popular Hashtags</h4>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re a teacher tweeting about the arts. You&#8217;d like to include a hashtag in your tweet to reach a larger audience but you&#8217;re not sure what the popular hashtags are in that niche.</p>
<p>You might have seen #arted used but you&#8217;re not sure if this is a popular choice.</p>
<p>A tool like <a href="https://hashtagify.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hashtagify.me</a> can be really handy (the basic features are free).</p>
<p>When I type in #arted I can see that the popularity is 42.7 (on a scale of 1-100). It also shows me a wordcloud of related hashtags. The bigger the hashtag, the more popular it is. #artsed (with an s) stands out.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/arted-1h4z7fk-21exp6b.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5215" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/arted-1h4z7fk-21exp6b.png" alt="#arted on hashtagify.me" width="600" height="561" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/arted-1h4z7fk-21exp6b.png 746w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/arted-1h4z7fk-21exp6b-300x280.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking on #artsed in the word cloud shows me that the popularity is higher (51) and I can also see some related hashtags I could explore as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/artsed-2o8psso-1x0bnvb.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5216" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/artsed-2o8psso-1x0bnvb.png" alt="#artsed hashtagify.me" width="600" height="576" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/artsed-2o8psso-1x0bnvb.png 763w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/artsed-2o8psso-1x0bnvb-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #414141; font-family: inherit; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 600;">Popular Hashtags In Education</span></h4>
<p>Jerry Blumengarten (aka <a href="http://www.cybraryman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybrary Man</a>) is well known for curating hashtags used in education.

<p>When you&#8217;re on your Twitter home feed, you might have noticed &#8220;Trends for you&#8221; on the left hand side. This is located in the search tab of the Twitter mobile app.</p>
<p>Trending topics are a mix of hashtags and regular phrases that show what&#8217;s currently being tweeted about most. They&#8217;re tailored for you based on your geographical location and who you follow.</p>
<p>You can click on these trends to find out more and join in the conversation by leaving a reply or tweeting something of interest.</p>
<p>Like a lot of aspects of Twitter and social media, clicking on trending topics can take you down a rabbit hole. So be warned! 😉</p>
<h3>What Are Twitter Chats?</h3>
<p>As we just saw, hashtags make it easier to search and follow the Twitter conversations on specific topics at any time. Sometimes people gather around to discuss a specific topic at a specific time. This is a Twitter chat and a hashtag is the glue that brings the Twitter chat together.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll now take a look at how Twitter Chats work and break down how you can get involved.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d prefer to watch a video to learn, this is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0OYSwAz8J8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great short overview of Twitter chats</a> by The University of Nebraska Medical Center.</p>

<p>Twitter chats are one of the best ways for educators to connect with other educators, exchange and debate ideas, ask for help and provide assistance, find new resources and take action.</p>
<p>Twitter chats are where educators meet at a set &#8220;meeting time&#8221; to engage in conversations by sending out tweets on a topic using a designated hashtag during a specific time on a certain day. Most Twitter chats last for an hour.</p>
<p>During the Twitter chat, you’ll see educators tweet their responses in real time. The best way to participate in a Twitter chat is to set up a search for the hashtag in <a href="http://tweetdeck.twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TweetDeck</a>, <a href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hootsuite</a>, or in the Twitter app on your mobile device.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;">Check out </span><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6bDjTIqSA0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Moore&#8217;s video</a><span style="font-family: inherit;"> which explains how to take part in a Twitter chat using TweetDeck. The video goes for 25 minutes because Laura has recorded herself </span>participating<span style="font-family: inherit;"> in an actual chat. You can just watch the first few minutes if you just want to learn how to get set up for a chat. </span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #414141; font-family: inherit; font-size: 32px; font-weight: 600;">Participating In A Twitter Chat</span></h4>
<p>Twitter chats normally have a moderator (or several) who guide the conversation during the chat using a Question and Answer format.</p>
<p>Prior to the Twitter chat, the moderators decide on the topic of the chat and organize a series of 5-10 questions to ask during the chat.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a Twitter chat using #moedchat (Missouri Educators Chat).</p>
<p>The chat normally starts by introducing the topic and asking participants to introduce themselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3938" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat61-2la7lx2.png" alt="Welcome to chat" width="650" height="152" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat61-2la7lx2.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat61-2la7lx2-300x70.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Participants respond by including the hashtag for the chat in their tweet (in this example all replies include the hashtag #moedchat).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat62-23cogso.png" alt="Recipients respond" width="650" height="83" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat62-23cogso.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat62-23cogso-300x38.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Once introductions are finished the moderators will commence guiding the conversation using their questions. Each question is normally starts with a Q and a number to indicate which question it is.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3941" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat64-11tqi9l.png" alt="Moderator question" width="650" height="128" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat64-11tqi9l.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat64-11tqi9l-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Participants&#8217; replies normally start with an A and a number to indicate which question they are answering as well as the chat hashtag.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3942" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat66-18yxrug.png" alt="Responses" width="650" height="708" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat66-18yxrug.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat66-18yxrug-275x300.png 275w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Twitter chats are a conversation — you can add your extra thoughts to anyone’s answer by replying to their tweet and including the hashtag. Provided the hashtag is included, everyone in the Twitter chat will see your reply.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3943" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat67-1j79lam.png" alt="Conversations" width="650" height="714" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat67-1j79lam.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2014/07/twitterchat67-1j79lam-273x300.png 273w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h4>I Can&#8217;t Keep Up With A Twitter Chat</h4>
<p>Tweets can fly fast in a Twitter chat! Don’t worry if you can’t keep up.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archives</strong>: Moderators often archive or curate the information and resources shared during the chat session. This used to be through tools like Storify but this service has closed. Sometimes a tool like <a href="https://wakelet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wakelet </a>is now used or there will be a specific website for a Twitter chat.</li>
<li><strong>Be prepared:</strong> Moderators often publish the questions that will be asked in advance so you can think ahead. You can also get your Tweetdeck set up before a chat so you&#8217;re ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Be selective:</strong> You don&#8217;t need to answer every question. Twitter chats are very flexible. They often go for an hour but no one minds how long you stay or how involved you are.</li>
<li><strong>Follow up:</strong> If you were interested in what someone had to say but you found the tweets were flying too fast, don&#8217;t worry. You can resume the conversation with people at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Bookmark</strong>: A relatively new feature of Twitter for mobile is Bookmarks. You can bookmark Tweets you’d like to refer to later. Tap the share icon next to a tweet and select Add Tweet to Bookmarks. Tap Bookmarks from your profile icon menu to access your saved tweets.</li>
<li><strong>Like</strong>: If you like a tweet by pressing on the heart, you can go back and look at these later. Just click on the Likes from your profile icon menu.</li>
<li><strong>Lurk</strong>: It&#8217;s fine to just watch a few chats before you decide to contribute. The first question is generally an introduction so don&#8217;t be afraid to say it&#8217;s your first time participating either.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popular Twitter Chats</h3>
<p>Education chats generally occur in the evenings each week, either during school terms or throughout the whole year. Most chats focus on a particular topic, subject area, theme, or year level.</p>
<p>Some states or countries have their own chats, but anyone is welcome to take part in any chat.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Twitter might feel overwhelming but if you give it a chance for a few weeks it will really start to make sense and you will see how it&#8217;s so popular with educators.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that Twitter chat hashtags are often used outside of the designated time frame to share resources, ask questions and help each other. The hashtag becomes a community!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #414141; font-family: inherit; font-size: 32px; font-weight: 600;">Introduction To Twitter</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most teachers who are using Twitter would probably agree that it is their number one way they build and connect with their PLN.</p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151630135X#bib65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 study</a> showed that the most popular tool K-12 teachers use to connect with others was Twitter.</p>
<h4>What Is Twitter?</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a social networking, news, and microblogging service that allows you to send out short messages called tweets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Along with text and links, tweets can also contain media (up to 4 photos, a video, or a GIF).</p>
<p>Tweets used to be limited to 140 characters but this increased to 280 characters by 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Twitter is a place that you can just lurk, by reading others&#8217; tweets, or contribute, by sending out your own tweets. Obviously, the latter is what you work towards as the more you put in, the more you get out!</p>
<p>You can read tweets without having your own Twitter account (as long as the accounts you&#8217;re following are public &#8212; and the majority are). To contribute, you will need an account which we will explain below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the great things about Twitter is that it is accessible on your computer, laptop, tablet, or phone. You can use the native Twitter website or app, or there are many other popular third party apps that aim to improve functionality and accessibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweetdeck </a>was once an independent app that has now been acquired by Twitter. Many users enjoy using it to organize their feed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Twitter is used by people in nearly every country around the world. 83% of 193 UN member countries <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/twitter-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have Twitter a presence</a>. For teachers, this means you have access to thousands of teachers with rich backgrounds and experiences that can contribute to your professional growth.</p>
<h4>Anatomy Of A Tweet</h4>
<p>Twitter is made up of tweets. We created this diagram to help you understand tweets better.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re welcome to share it with others or display it on your blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Anatomy-of-a-Tweet-1jxoyob-slkh5l.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5207 size-full" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Anatomy-of-a-Tweet-1jxoyob-slkh5l.png" alt="Anatomy of a Tweet | Edublogs Teacher Challenge" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Anatomy-of-a-Tweet-1jxoyob-slkh5l.png 800w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Anatomy-of-a-Tweet-1jxoyob-slkh5l-150x150.png 150w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Anatomy-of-a-Tweet-1jxoyob-slkh5l-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h4>Interacting With Tweets</h4>
<p>When you see a tweet, there are certain things <strong>you can click on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>person&#8217;s name</strong> to see their profile page. You can look at their bio and see all their tweets.</li>
<li><strong>Follow</strong> to have the tweeter&#8217;s future tweets show up on your homepage.</li>
<li>A <strong>link</strong> (if there is one) to open a website in your browser.</li>
<li>A <strong>hashtag</strong> to see other tweets that are categorized with the same hashtag (regardless of whether you follow the people using that hashtag)</li>
<li><strong>Like</strong> (the heart) &#8212; this shows your appreciation, agreement, or acknowledgment of the tweet. Simply, tap/click the heart to like the tweet (tap/click again to undo).</li>
<li><strong>Retweet</strong> to share the tweet with your own followers. This demonstrates that you found the tweet interesting or shareworthy. You will also have the option to add a comment to the retweet.</li>
<li><strong>Direct message</strong> &#8212; you can message someone privately or start a private group conversation. Depending on individual settings, you might only be able to direct message someone if you both follow each other.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> &#8212; this allows you to either read what other people have said in a public reply, or add your own reply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Think You&#8217;re Not Interested In Twitter? Think Again!</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Twitter is more than just &#8220;another social networking tool&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It generally isn&#8217;t about reconnecting with people you knew in high school or sharing what you&#8217;re cooking for dinner. Of course, some people only use Twitter for fun, although for most educators Twitter is about connecting with like minded individuals for personalized and ongoing professional development.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are millions of tweets flying around in the Twitterverse 24-7 but the good thing is you can use Twitter as your time and inclination permits!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.21stcenturycollaborative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheryl Nussbaum-Beach</a> has shared an analogy of Twitter being like a river. The river keeps flowing but sometimes you might just walk past and have a quick look, sometimes you might hang around and dip your toes in, other times you might spend hours swimming around.</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>
<p>In this three minute video, Alec Couros explains <a href="http://youtu.be/EqSCR3HU4eg">how Twitter is used effectively in education</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqSCR3HU4eg?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Benefits Of Using Twitter</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Twitter is like a virtual staffroom where you can catch up with your PLN. It&#8217;s a place where educators can find advice, give advice, find great links, share work, and engage in general musings about education.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Want examples?</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://chrisbetcher.com/2011/04/1483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In this post</a>, Chris Betcher describes what he got out of tweeting for just 10 minutes.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Similarly, <a href="http://whatedsaid.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/dear-teacher-who-wasnt-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this post</a> Edna Sackson describes what she got out of 30 minutes on Twitter one morning.</li>
<li>In this<a href="https://julietrevell.blogspot.com/2019/03/whats-my-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> post, New Zealand teacher Juliet Revell </a>explains some fantastic professional and personal opportunities that she experienced thanks to building a PLN on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/pphYBgMkyhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This video</a> by Matt Miller offers snapshot of some of the things you might see on Twitter in any given session.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pphYBgMkyhI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>While these examples aren&#8217;t new and some minor functions of Twitter have changed, the basic premise remains; there are countless ways educators are using Twitter to benefit themselves and their students.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tweet from a high school history teacher who joined Twitter in 2019.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was hesitant to join Twitter. I didn&#8217;t quite understand what purpose it could serve me as a teacher. Now that I&#8217;ve followed just under 100 educators I GET IT. There is hope here. There is inspiration here. There is growth here.</p>

<h3>Five Steps To Building Your PLN Via Twitter</h3>
<h4>1. Join</h4>
<p>The sign up process is easy. Just follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://twitter.com</a> and click on the sign up box, or go directly to <a href="https://twitter.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/signup</a>.</li>
<li>You will be required to enter information such as your name and email address as you&#8217;re guided through the sign up process.</li>
<li>Once you sign up for an account, you can select a unique username. Try not to make your username too long and make it something that identifies you, like your name, rather than a complex nickname.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;re signed up, you can <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-customize-your-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customize your profile. </a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete your bio</strong> so people know who you are. You have 160 characters for your bio. Educators often share the age group or subject they teach, and particular interests.</li>
<li><strong>Add a profile photo</strong>. Real photos can be a better choice than a cartoon avatar. It helps you to build your relationship with your PLN. Bios and photos can hold a lot of weight in virtual relationships.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll also be able to add a <strong>header photo.</strong> Popular header images for teachers include landscapes, a classroom photo, or a quote. <strong>Tip</strong>: You can make a personalized Twitter header image with <a href="https://www.canva.com/create/twitter-headers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a>.</li>

<h4>2. Follow People</h4>
<p>Following someone on Twitter means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are subscribing to their tweets and their updates will appear in your home timeline</li>
<li>That person is able to send you a private direct message if you&#8217;re following each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Following isn&#8217;t necessarily a reciprocal relationship, like Facebook friendships. Someone can follow you without you following them back and vice versa. You don&#8217;t need to wait for approval to follow someone either, as long as their account is public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are thousands of teachers around the world on Twitter, you just have to know where to find them!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No ideas?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Start with our <strong>Edublogs team</strong> like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/edublogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@edublogs</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/suewaters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@suewaters</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ronnieburt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ronnieburt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Edublogs_Eugene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Edublogs_Eugene </a>and me, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kathleen_morris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@kathleen_morris</a></p>
<p>There are <em>many</em> <strong>educational thought leaders</strong> who thousands of people enjoy following such as:</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, there are many popular sources for keeping up to date with the latest <strong>news, trends, and research in education</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>

<li>ISTE (<a href="https://twitter.com/iste" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ISTE</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples listed above are only the tip of the iceberg and far from an exhaustive list!</p>
<p>Once you have a few people to follow, look at who they are following and you will start to build up your PLN.</p>
<p>You can also adopt some Twitter regulars as your mentors and ask them to put a tweet out to encourage their followers to connect with you.</p>
<p>Twitter also regularly shows you suggestions of people you could follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Watch this video to learn how to follow and connect with people on Twitter.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oGEGVtDvwBc?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>3. Lurk</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">You&#8217;ll need to spend some time checking out the stream of tweets and getting the hang of <em>tweeting</em>, <em>retweeting</em>, <em>direct messaging, </em>and <em>hashtags</em>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some people say Twitter isn&#8217;t as intuitive as other web tools but it doesn&#8217;t take long for it to make sense. Give yourself a few weeks to try it. Whenever you have a few spare minutes, open Twitter, scroll through your feed, click on some links, watch how people are interacting with each other.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>If the people you&#8217;re following don&#8217;t interest you, it&#8217;s fine to unfollow them. Remember, you&#8217;re in charge of building your own personal PLN.</p>
<h4>4. Contribute</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">When you&#8217;ve lurked for a while, jump and contribute! Like or retweet a few tweets, reply to tweets that resonated with you, and send tweets of your own. You could try contacting a few people via direct message too &#8212; ask them a question or introduce yourself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">It may take some time to get the hang of how Twitter works. We&#8217;ve made this cheat sheet to help. Feel free to share it with others or use it on your own blog.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-20fh0uh-1u6qhrm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5209" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-20fh0uh-1u6qhrm.png" alt="Twitter Cheat Sheet for Teachers | Building Your PLN Edublogs Teacher Challenge Course" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-20fh0uh-1u6qhrm.png 800w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-20fh0uh-1u6qhrm-150x150.png 150w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2015/11/Twitter-Cheat-Sheet-20fh0uh-1u6qhrm-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Remember, the more you put in, the more you get out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to start replying to people, retweeting tweets, asking questions, and striking up conversations. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many teachers on Twitter are very friendly and always happy to help newbies find their feet!</span><br />
</span></p>
<h5>What To Tweet About</h5>
<p>Still not sure what you could be tweeting about? How about:</p>
<ul>
<li>A photo from a lesson</li>
<li>A link to something interesting you&#8217;ve read</li>
<li>A question about a topic you&#8217;re interested in</li>
<li>A request for a resource</li>
<li>A link to something from your own blog or someone else&#8217;s blog</li>
<li>A favorite online tool you like to use with students</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Stick With It!</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Many regular Twitter users have commented that it took them a few attempts to get going with Twitter. Sticking with it is so important. Make yourself check into Twitter daily for a month before you make any decisions about whether it is for you. </span></p>
<p>It takes time to build rapport with people. When you do, you&#8217;ll find your professional world will be so enlightened and your students will be better for it!</p>
<p>Remember, you definitely won&#8217;t be seeing everything that&#8217;s tweeted, so don&#8217;t feel like you have to. You&#8217;ll receive notifications when someone replies to you, mentions you, tags you, or direct messages you. Otherwise, Twitter works fairly serendipitously and you&#8217;ll just see what you see!</p>
<h3>Useful Video</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Effective teaching and learning doesn&#8217;t occur in a vacuum. To be the best teacher you can be, you need a diverse and innovative network.</p>
<p>As we outlined in <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-making-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step Two</a>, traditionally, the staff at your school was your main network of teachers to collaborate with. This network may be fantastic but can become an echo chamber for the same ideas, values, and perspectives.</p>
<p>With Twitter, the barriers of distance and access are broken down and the world is at your fingertips!</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-twitter-chats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next step,</a> we explore Twitter further by looking at hashtags and Twitter chats.</p>
<h3>Your Task</h3>
<p>PLNs are about sharing, collaborating, and learning from and with others. Here’s your chance to ask a question, comment, and get involved!</p>
<p>We’d like you to add your voice and ideas to our ongoing conversation on building your own PLN by undertaking <strong>one or more of the following challenges</strong>:</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-define/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first step,</a> we unpacked the definition of a PLN and looked at the benefits of being a connected educator.</p>
<p>You may now be wondering how to begin building your own PLN.</p>
<p>The aim of this step is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer an overview of how to build a PLN</li>

<h3>The Networked Teacher</h3>
<p>Around a decade ago, Alec Couros created two diagrams that have been shared thousands of times.</p>
<p>This first diagram demonstrates how a teacher would traditionally connect and learn.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5175" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Typical-Teacher-Network-Alec-Couros-qns46b-15g33yz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5175" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Typical-Teacher-Network-Alec-Couros-qns46b-15g33yz.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="674" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Typical-Teacher-Network-Alec-Couros-qns46b-15g33yz.jpg 1024w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Typical-Teacher-Network-Alec-Couros-qns46b-15g33yz-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5175" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/courosa/344832659/in/album-72157615129270288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alec Couros</a>, CC CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</figcaption></figure>
<p>This diagram of &#8220;The Networked Teacher&#8221; demonstrates just some of the ways that educators can connect now that technology is at their fingertips. Note, the &#8220;old&#8221; ways of connecting are still there.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5174" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Networked-Teacher-Alec-Couros-1cr3hw9-1g5s0q0.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5174" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Networked-Teacher-Alec-Couros-1cr3hw9-1g5s0q0.jpg" alt="The Networked Teacher diagram by Alec Couros showing the different media that educators can connect with -- blogs, social bookmarking, chat etc." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Networked-Teacher-Alec-Couros-1cr3hw9-1g5s0q0.jpg 1024w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Networked-Teacher-Alec-Couros-1cr3hw9-1g5s0q0-300x225.jpg 300w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/The-Networked-Teacher-Alec-Couros-1cr3hw9-1g5s0q0-510x382.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5174" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/courosa/2922421696/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alec Couros</a> (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alec&#8217;s brother George <a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/6684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us that the arrows go back and forth</a> and it&#8217;s not only about what you consume but what you create. You can give as well as receive.</p>
<h3>What Tools Are Used?</h3>
<p>Teachers from all over the globe are online and learning together, but where exactly do you find these teachers and develop working relationships with them?</p>
<p>In a 2016 study called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151630135X#bib65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Together we are better: Professional Learning Networks For Teachers&#8221;</a>, K-12 teachers were asked how they use PLNs.</p>
<p>The most popular tool in the sample was Twitter with 53% of participants indicating that they used this tool to connect with others.</p>
<p>Other popular tools listed in the survey included blogs, Edmodo, Facebook, Discovery Education Network, and Pinterest.</p>
<p>84% of survey participants indicated that they use more than one medium or site.</p>
<h3>How Are Teachers Connecting On Online Platforms?</h3>
<p>Teachers use social media and other online spaces in a variety of ways to connect with their PLN.</p>
<p>Here are ten examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> &#8212; Educators follow people they&#8217;re interested in, ranging from &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; to everyday teachers in a similar subject area or age group. Teachers also use hashtags to follow topics of interest, and join Twitter chats to discuss ideas in real time. Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/edublogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edublogs </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/CampusPressWP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CampusPress</a> on Twitter. <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The next step</a> in this series will explain how to start using Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> &#8212; Educators follow pages and profiles of people and businesses involved in education. They also join Facebook groups to post questions, ask for feedback, and respond to others. Visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edublogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edublogs Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook for Education</a> to start learning something new.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong> &#8212; You can follow educators to get new ideas for lessons, activities, learning spaces and more. Hashtags make it easy to search for topics you&#8217;re interested in. Check out Tony Vincent&#8217;s <a href="https://learninginhand.com/blog/instagram-for-teachers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Instagram For Teachers.</a></li>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong> &#8212; Pinterest is ultimately a &#8216;discovery engine&#8217; and is becoming a go-to for many educators looking for fresh ideas, resources, and connections. Be sure to <a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/edublogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow Edublogs on Pinterest</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> &#8212; Blogs play an important role in most educators&#8217; PLNs. This might include reading blogs from a variety of different people or writing your own blog. Visit <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step Five of this series</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Email newsletters</strong> &#8212; There might be an educator, thought leader, or blogger who you really enjoy following. Chances are, they have an email newsletter that you can subscribe to for free to have curated news and contented delivered straight to inbox!</li>
<li><strong>Voxer</strong> &#8212; This walkie-talkie like tool can be used as an app on your mobile device or on your computer. Educators can engage in both synchronous and asynchronous conversations about their professional practice.

<h3><span style="color: #414141; font-family: inherit; font-size: 32px; font-weight: 600;">Tips For Developing Relationships</span></h3>
<p>PLNs are all about relationships! Here are a few tips to consider as you begin to build your PLN.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invest some time</strong> in building your PLN. Set aside even 15 or 20 minutes a day and you&#8217;ll build momentum in no time.</li>
<li><strong>PLNs work both ways.</strong> Remember, the more you share, the more you&#8217;ll find you receive in return.</li>
<li><strong>Try different tools. </strong>There are so many different forms of social media, online tools, and ways to connect. Dip your toes in and see how educators are using various tools.</li>
<li><strong>Find tools that work best for you. </strong>While it&#8217;s definitely worth giving things a try, not every platform is for everyone. Choose to dedicate time to the tools you enjoy and find the most rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Follow up</strong> <strong>with people. </strong>If someone connects with you whether it&#8217;s through a tweet, blog comment, Facebook group, or any platform, thank them, ask a question, and get to know them. These are the building blocks of forming a relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> If you find someone who already has a number of connections (on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or wherever) ask them to introduce you to others. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help when you&#8217;re figuring out how various platforms work either.</li>
<li><strong>Curate wisely.</strong> If you want to share interesting resources with people in your PLN, make sure you read beyond a headline and share things you think will be truly useful.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify</strong>. Try to connect with people with diverse opinions and points of view. It&#8217;s easy for &#8220;birds of a feather to flock together&#8221;, however, sometimes there is more to gain from communicating with a range of people from different backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Involve your students.</strong> Once you get to know a few educators, you might start to think about ways you can connect your students. Check out our <a href="https://www.theedublogger.com/global-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edublogger&#8217;s Guide To Global Collaboration</a> for lots of ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> As you begin to explore PLNs and online communities, share this information with others in your school or district. Maybe they don&#8217;t realize this wonderful virtual opportunity exists!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Barriers To Creating A PLN</h3>
<p>In our first step, we looked at many of the advantages of building a PLN. If the benefits of being a connected educator are clear, what holds so many teachers back from building their own PLN?</p>
<p>Perhaps the first obstacle is that many teachers simply don&#8217;t know about PLNs. They don&#8217;t know there are thousands of educators from around the world who are online connecting, collaborating, and learning together.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/how-do-i-get-a-pln-tom-whitby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Whitby</a> has outlined three deterrents to educators using PLNs as a tool for ongoing learning.</p>
<blockquote><p>The PLN is a mindset, not the outcome of a workshop or the PD offered annually by many school districts. It is not a one-shot fix.</p></blockquote>
<p>Teachers have learned through the &#8220;sit and get&#8221; model for generations. This mindset shift where you need to realize that <em>you are responsible</em> for your own learning and <em>you can take control</em> can be difficult to adapt to.</p>
<p>Additionally, prioritizing the investment in time that building a PLN requires would certainly be an obstacle for some. <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/pln-making-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step seven</a> in this series offers some tips on finding time to invest in your PLN.</p>
<blockquote><p>Successful users of PLNs overwhelm the uninitiated with techno-babble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, the future steps in this course can break down any overwhelming &#8220;techno-babble&#8221;.</p>
<p>You will probably find that many teachers who are regular uses of online technologies proclaim that they are &#8220;not very tech savvy&#8221;. Even George Couros who has a <a href="https://twitter.com/gcouros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter </a>following of 224,000+ has said, &#8220;<a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/7638" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I&#8217;m not that good with technology and you probably aren&#8217;t either</a>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote><p>It requires, at least at first, digital literacy beyond a Google search.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is certainly essential that educators develop their digital literacy. As Silvia Tolisano has pointed out, our notion of what it means to be literate or illustrate <a href="http://langwitches.org/blog/2018/07/05/our-notion-of-literate-illiterate-calls-for-an-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calls for an update. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Literate-Illiterate-Langwitches-quote-1yxm8cp-2noqodo.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5176" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Literate-Illiterate-Langwitches-quote-1yxm8cp-2noqodo.png" alt="... merely reading and writing in text form and on analog platforms is simply not enough to call yourself literate. The skills and abilities MUST include reading and writing in various media forms and on multiple platforms INCLUDING digital spaces. We can’t continue to differentiate between our analog and digital world. We live in ONE world after all." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Literate-Illiterate-Langwitches-quote-1yxm8cp-2noqodo.png 1024w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/Literate-Illiterate-Langwitches-quote-1yxm8cp-2noqodo-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>If you feel like you need to improve your own digital literacy skills, don&#8217;t despair! You don&#8217;t need to learn everything <em>before</em> you embark on building your PLN. We will provide you with the essential tips and skills throughout this course and you can learn as you go.</p>
<p>If you feel like your skills need updating in other areas, such as blogging and online tools, we have other <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/#teacher-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free courses</a> you can work through at your own pace too.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Becoming a connected educator is something that takes work but has enormous advantages for both you and your students. In fact, many educators would say that it&#8217;s an essential responsibility of teachers to connect and commit to lifelong learning.</p>
<p>As George Couros has said, &#8220;<a href="https://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/4156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isolation is now a choice educators make</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to free yourself from isolation. The following steps in this series breaks down three powerful avenues to becoming a connected educator &#8212; Twitter, blogs, and content curation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Unpack the definition of a PLN and &#8220;connected educator&#8221;</li>
<li>Help you understand why educators create their own PLNs and how they use them</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Is A PLN?</h3>
<p>Back in 1998 when the internet was in its infancy, <a href="http://www.tobincls.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel R. Tobin</a> wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-your-personal-learning-network-daniel-tobin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article</a> about the term “Personal Learning Network&#8221; which was abbreviated to PLN. This term was used to describe a network of people and resources that support ongoing learning.</p>
<p>Whether or not Tobin actually coined the term PLN is up for debate. As <a href="http://clintlalonde.net/2009/10/08/on-historically-defining-personal-learning-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Lalonde has pointed out</a>, others, such as <a href="http://files.campus.edublogs.org/blogs.berkshirecc.edu/dist/6/32/files/2007/10/collaborativelearningsoljournal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dori Digenti</a>, also wrote about the term in the late 90s.</p>
<p>Digeni said,</p>
<blockquote><p>The PLN consists of relationships between individuals where the goal is enhancement of mutual learning. The currency of the PLN is learning in the form of feedback, insights, documentation, new contacts, or new business opportunities. It is based on reciprocity and a level of trust that each party is actively seeking value-added information for the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>The term has evolved and is now sometimes referred to as a Professional Learning Network &#8212; taking into account that fact that most &#8220;connected educators&#8221; use their PLN for professional growth and interaction.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/how-do-i-get-a-pln-tom-whitby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Whitby</a> has pointed out, there can even be a hybrid of the personal or professional learning network &#8212; the <em>Personalized</em> Learning Network.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the shift in nuance maintains that participants are both personal and professional learners. A PLN is a tool that uses social media and technology to collect, communicate, collaborate and create with connected colleagues anywhere at any time. Participating educators, worldwide, make requests and share resources.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Are PLNs Exclusive To Education?</h3>
<p>PLNs don&#8217;t just exist in the education world. They are important in all aspects of the business world, various vocations, and hobbies.</p>
<p>We contacted <a href="http://www.tobincls.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel R. Tobin</a> to ask him about how he came up with the term Personal Learning Network. We wanted to find out if he coined the term in relation to a particular industry or field.</p>
<p>Daniel told us,</p>
<blockquote><p>It came from my own experience.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about how I had learned to do the various jobs I had over the course of my career, I realized that I had built an extensive network of people who had helped me learn. These included managers and colleagues and people I had met while doing research for my books, speaking at conferences, attending workshops, etc.</p>
<p>As I started writing about corporate training and development, I realized that what I had learned from my PLN was greater and more important than what I had learned from my formal education.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, many teachers who are active online have remarked that they&#8217;ve learned a great deal more from their PLN than from any professional development session they&#8217;ve attended.</p>
<h3>Are PLNs Something New?</h3>
<p>All teachers know successful teaching and learning does not occur in a vacuum. Teachers have always relied on others for guidance, ideas, inspiration, support, and new perspectives. Naturally, some teachers are more active in their interactions than others.</p>
<p>Traditionally, all this interaction might take place in one school community. Teachers might have rarely connected with educators from other locations &#8212; apart from an occasional conference or professional development opportunity.</p>
<p>Technology changed all this.</p>
<p>Like in many other industries, educators now have access to people from all corners of the globe 24/7. This may largely be through social media but other platforms as well, such as blogs, online communities, and news sites.</p>
<p>So many barriers have been removed &#8212; geography, culture, language, timezones, travel, costs, logistics.</p>
<p>Embracing new networks and building a PLN doesn&#8217;t mean throwing out your old connections. Of course, it will always be valuable to talk to the teachers next door and down the hall. But imagine the possibilities of <em>building on</em> that network in diverse ways!</p>

<h3>Being A Connected Educator</h3>
<p>A connected educator is someone who collaborates online and uses a range of tools to build their own PLN.</p>
<p>Watch the <a href="http://youtu.be/K4Vd4JP_DB8">following five minute video</a> to learn more about being a connected educator. It shows interviews with educators who explain the importance of being &#8220;connected&#8221; in order to be effective teachers and leaders.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4Vd4JP_DB8?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Why Create A PLN?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why all teachers should develop a PLN.</p>
<p>Here are eight benefits of having a PLN:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You are in charge of your own professional development.</strong> PD is no longer something that you have to &#8220;sit and get&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong>You can explore your own interests, needs, and passions (or your students&#8217;).</strong> You might have a student who is struggling with reading, or you might have heard of makerspaces and decide you want to learn more about that, maybe you have a student who wants to research global warming, or perhaps you want to find a better system for running a sports day at your school. You can turn to your PLN for advice and support with all these sorts of things.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 learning offers the flexibility to learn and connect at a time that suits you.</strong> You don&#8217;t have to wait for a PD or conference. And 24/7 learning certainly doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be constantly online either &#8212; you decide how much time you want to invest and when.</li>
<li><strong>You can learn and connect in a way that you enjoy.</strong> This might be via videos, podcasts, text, social media, Skype, blogging &#8230; the list goes on.</li>
<li><strong>There can be light and shade to your PLN. </strong>You can engage in a general chat about education (or anything) to debrief, laugh, or unwind. Or, you can engage in deep discussion, debate, and reflection that can really challenge and transform your thinking and teaching. The choice is yours and there will probably be a time and place for both.</li>
<li><strong>You can stay current</strong> on research and best practice, regardless of whether this information is being discussed in your own school, district (or even country!).</li>
<li><strong>A PLN allows for broad brainstorming or fine tuning.</strong> You might know very little about a certain topic and ask your PLN for any/all entry points into exploring the concept. At the other end of the spectrum, you may have already done a lot of work on a topic and use your PLN to fine tune your ideas and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Globally connected students need globally connected teachers.</strong> Having your own PLN is a key way to also help your students connect with others and start developing their own networks. We know this is important to enrich student learning and help students thrive in the changing labor market.</li>

<h3>Four Big Ideas Around The Connected Educator</h3>
<p>Silvia Tolisana (aka Langwitches) has written about <a href="http://langwitches.org/blog/2014/09/28/4-big-ideas-around-the-connected-educator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four big ideas</a> that surface when thinking about connected educators.</p>
<p><a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/4-Big-Ideas-Around-the-Connected-Educator-Langwitches-1lv8r3n-shn01o.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5181" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/4-Big-Ideas-Around-the-Connected-Educator-Langwitches-1lv8r3n-shn01o.jpg" alt="4 Big Ideas Around The Connected Educator - model, isolation, crowdsource, perspective" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/4-Big-Ideas-Around-the-Connected-Educator-Langwitches-1lv8r3n-shn01o.jpg 800w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/4-Big-Ideas-Around-the-Connected-Educator-Langwitches-1lv8r3n-shn01o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2018/07/4-Big-Ideas-Around-the-Connected-Educator-Langwitches-1lv8r3n-shn01o-510x382.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>I think about the <strong>isolation</strong> of a teacher within their classroom walls and how connectedness to a global network of experts and peers could expose and add multiple <strong>perspectives</strong> to their world view and professional practice.</p>
<p>I am amazed every time by the transformative nature of teaching and learning, when harnessing the power of a network to <strong>crowdsource</strong> authentic data, resources, connections and collaborators.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the idea of being able to <strong>model</strong> for our students what connected learning in an interconnected world means is a moral imperative for educators who are charged to prepare our kids for their future.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can unpack these concepts further by reading <a href="http://langwitches.org/blog/2014/09/28/4-big-ideas-around-the-connected-educator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silvia&#8217;s post. </a></p>
<h3>Building Your Own PLN</h3>
<p>The great thing about a PLN is that it&#8217;s personal!</p>
<p>You make all the choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>What tools you use!</li>
<li>Who you connect with!</li>
<li>How you want to learn!</li>
<li>When you want to learn!</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea of this series is to guide you through the process of building your own PLN and give you a taste of the opportunities that are out there.</p>
<p>Remember, we each have our own preference of what online tools work best for us.</p>
<p>Throughout the seven part series, we&#8217;ve included popular tools for building a PLN to help get you started.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A PLN is a network of people and resources that support ongoing learning.</p>
<p>We believe all teachers could benefit from having a PLN.</p>
<p>You might be in a fantastic school but in some ways, schools can become echo chambers for the same beliefs and viewpoints. It can be easy to go with the status quo and fail to really question things or bring in new ideas. A simple conversation with someone from a very different community can be so eye opening.</p>

				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Welcome to the ninth step in our <a href="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/personal-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free self-paced course</a><strong> </strong>to <strong>help you set up your own personal or professional educator blog</strong>!</p>
<p>This is a short step that aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help you understand how plugins are used on blogs.</li>
<li>Show you how to activate and deactivate plugins.</li>
<li>Activate plugins.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Are Plugins?</h3>
<p>A plugin is a piece of software that does something specific to your blog.</p>
<p>Plugins extend functionality or add new features to your blog such as extra widgets, an easy way to add images to posts, ability to embed documents, add sliders, add contact forms, and more.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have plugins on your blog, however, activating some can make the blogging experience better for both you and your audience.  You don&#8217;t need to know anything about software or coding to use plugins; you can turn them on or off with the click of a button!</p>
<h3>Plugins On Educator Blogs</h3>
<p>There are numerous plugins that you can activate in <strong>Plugins &gt; All</strong> in your dashboard.  Plugins should only be activated if you plan to use the functionality provided by the plugin.  You shouldn&#8217;t activate plugins you don&#8217;t use.</p>
<p>Here is a list of plugins that are suitable for activating on your blog:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Activate Plugins</h3>
<p>You activate plugins as follows:</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Plugins &gt; All</strong> in your dashboard.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4853" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugins61-25k4298.png" alt="All Plugins" width="650" height="261" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugins61-25k4298.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugins61-25k4298-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>2.  Click on <strong>Activate</strong> below the plugin you want to use.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4614" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/class67-2gc74ul.jpg" alt="Activate" width="514" height="122" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/class67-2gc74ul.jpg 514w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/class67-2gc74ul-300x71.jpg 300w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/class67-2gc74ul-510x122.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></p>
<p>Some plugins have an administration page where you can set options specific for that plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugins with configuration options add a new item under the <strong>Settings menu</strong>.</li>
<li>Some plugins also add widgets to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets</strong></li>
<li>Click on the Documentation link on the plugin for more information on how to use the plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.  Click on <strong>Deactivate</strong> if you want to turn a plugin off.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4854" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin62-28o4ged.jpg" alt="Click Deactivate" width="569" height="145" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin62-28o4ged.jpg 569w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin62-28o4ged-300x76.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /></p>
<h3>Activate Plugins on your blog</h3>
<p>Here is a list of plugins we recommend you activate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://help.edublogs.org/compfight-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compfight</a></li>
<li><a href="http://help.edublogs.org/easy-tables-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Tables</a></li>
<li><a href="http://help.edublogs.org/visual-editor-widget-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Editor Widget</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should always test a plugin once you&#8217;ve activated the plugin to see how it works and then deactivate the plugin if you don&#8217;t intend to use it.</p>
<p>To test Compfight and Easy tables plugins, you need to write a new post.  The Compfight plugin adds a Compfight icon to your visual editor that enables you to quickly find and add Creative Commons images to posts.  The Easy Table plugin adds a tables tool to your visual editor for adding simple tables to posts.</p>
<p>To test the image widget and visual editor widget plugins you need to go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets </strong>and add their widget to your sidebar.</p>
<p>Remember, you&#8217;ll see numerous plugins that you can activate in <strong>Plugins &gt; All</strong> in your dashboard.  But you should only activate plugins you plan to use.  Don&#8217;t activate plugins you don&#8217;t use.  If you decide to activate other plugins, remember to test the plugin after you&#8217;ve activated it and deactivate it if you don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>The documentation link under a plugin takes you to the support page that explains how the plugin is used.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4857" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin63-2kpdndo.jpg" alt="Documentation" width="570" height="222" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin63-2kpdndo.jpg 570w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/plugin63-2kpdndo-300x117.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<h3>Your Task</h3>
<ol>
<li>Activate Compfight, Easy Tables, and the Visual Editor plugins in <strong>Plugins &gt; All</strong>.</li>
<li>Test each plugin and then write a post to discuss what you learned about plugins or tell us which plugin(s) you liked and why.  Remember to leave a link to your post in a comment here so we can have a look at your new post.</li>

				<![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>This series is designed to guide students step by step through the process of learning to blog. The activities can be completed at your own pace and in any order.</p>
<p>The aim of this eighth activity is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to embed content from other sites into your posts and pages.</li>
<li>Embed content into posts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Embedding Content in Posts</h3>
<p>Embedding content like slides, quizzes, polls, videos and storybooks into posts creates opportunities for reader engagement and interaction not achievable using plain text, images or videos.</p>
<p>Most online tools provide embed code that you can use to embed what you&#8217;ve found or created into posts.</p>
<p><strong>Below are examples of embedded content created using online tools:</strong></p>
<p>Animal Quiz on PhotoPeach</p>
<p><iframe src="https://photopeach.com/embed/h8m2c2" width="445" height="296" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h3>Create Content Using Online Tool</h3>
<p>There is a wide range of online tools and apps that you can use to quickly create content which can be embedded into posts.</p>
<p>Many of these tools require an account to be created and some don&#8217;t allow the site to be used by a person under 13 years of age.  You need to check their Terms of service or privacy page to make sure you are allowed to use the site before creating an account</p>
<p><strong>The following are a few online tools that can be used by students under 13 for you to try:</strong></p>
<h4>Photopeach</h4>
<p><a href="https://photopeach.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photopeach</a> is used for creating slideshows and quizzes.  <a href="https://youtu.be/zCfpgJoRWTc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this video</a> to learn how to create a Photopeach slideshow.</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCfpgJoRWTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h4>Biteable</h4>
<p><a href="https://biteable.com/">Biteable</a> online tools that allow you to make animated videos and presentations easily.   <a href="https://youtu.be/PUKWRHhmId4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this video</a> to learn how to make a video using Biteable.</p>

<h3>Embed in Post</h3>
<p>Once you’ve created your content using one of the above online tools you embed into a post as follows:</p>
<p>1. Copy the embed code.</p>
<p>If you created a Photopeach you click on <strong>Embed in blog icon</strong> when you view your slideshow</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4774" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/photopeach61-1up6ff8.jpg" alt="Click on Embed icon" width="728" height="298" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/photopeach61-1up6ff8.jpg 728w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/photopeach61-1up6ff8-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>

<p>If you created a Biteable video the embed code is located in the Controls panel when you view your video:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4750" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql.jpg 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql-300x173.jpg 300w" alt="Biteaable embed code" width="650" height="375" /></p>

<h3>Using Videos in Posts</h3>
<p>Videos are another great way to grab your readers attention and encourage them to read your posts.  Videos can also help get the point of your post across while enhancing the look of your blog.</p>
<p>There are two options for using videos in Posts</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Use videos from video sharing websites like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED</a>.</li>
<li>Option 2: Create your own videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Embed From Video Sharing Websites</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED</a> are good websites for finding video resources and their videos can easily be embedded into your posts using their video URL.</p>
<p><strong>You embed from YouTube, Vimeo and TED as follows:</strong></p>
<p>1.  Copy the Video URL.</p>
<p>For YouTube videos you need to click on the <strong>Share link</strong> under the YouTube video you want to add.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4734" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video61-27quqhi.png" alt="Copy the Video URL" width="650" height="362" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video61-27quqhi.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video61-27quqhi-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>For <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED</a> you copy the video URL from the address bar of your browser.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4738" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/vimeo61-21b7u9t.jpg" alt="Copy URL" width="386" height="89" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/vimeo61-21b7u9t.jpg 386w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/vimeo61-21b7u9t-300x69.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></p>
<p>3.  Go to <strong>Posts &gt; Add New</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3664" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/post61-2cscprc.png" alt="Add New" width="650" height="159" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/post61-2cscprc.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/post61-2cscprc-300x73.png 300w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/post61-2cscprc-500x122.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>4.  Paste the URL on a line by itself in your post editor.</p>
<p>The URL will change to a preview of your video in your Visual Editor.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4735" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video62-1orvm9i.png" alt="Paste the URL" width="650" height="138" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video62-1orvm9i.png 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/video62-1orvm9i-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
<p>The link must be on its own line without any characters or whitespaces before or after the URL and must not be hyperlinked otherwise it won’t embed.</p>
<p>You can tell if a URL is hyperlinked by clicking on the link. If the hyperlink button in the toolbar highlights and a link box with the option to edit appears, like the screenshot below, it means your link is hyperlinked.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Remove Link</strong> icon to remove the hyperlink.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4736" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/youtube61-1ewc7l6.jpg" alt="Remove link" width="267" height="102" /></p>
<h3>Create own videos</h3>
<p>There is a wide range of video creation and editing tools and apps that you can use to quickly create and/or edit videos.</p>
<p>Here is a couple of simple ones to try:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://biteable.com/">Biteable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.powtoon.com/edu-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powtoon</a></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://biteable.com/">Biteable</a> and <a href="https://www.powtoon.com/edu-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powtoon</a> are online tools that allow you to make animated videos and presentations easily.  <a href="https://youtu.be/PUKWRHhmId4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch this video</a> to learn how to make a video using Biteable or refer to <a href="https://www.powtoon.com/tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowToon&#8217;s quick start guide</a> to learn how to create a PowToon video.</p>
<p><strong>Below are examples of animated videos created using these tools:</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="https://biteable.com/watch/embed/australian-animals-1393344" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://biteable.com/watch/australian-animals-1393344">Australian Animals</a> on <a href="https://biteable.com">Biteable</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="401" src="https://www.powtoon.com/embed/eE2pUuPMkGA/" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Once you&#8217;ve created your video you embed into a post as follows:</strong></p>
<p>1. Copy the video embed code.</p>
<p>If you created a Biteable video the embed code is located in the Controls panel when you view your video:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4750" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql.jpg" alt="Biteaable embed code" width="650" height="375" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql.jpg 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/biteable62-2atd2ql-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>For Powtoon videos you click on <strong>Embed</strong> when you view your Powtoon video:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4751" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon61-xybjd2.jpg" alt="Powtoon embed " width="650" height="439" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon61-xybjd2.jpg 650w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon61-xybjd2-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>then click on 640 x 401 and copy the embed code:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4752" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon62-1h9styy.jpg" alt="Copy embed code" width="679" height="373" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon62-1h9styy.jpg 679w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/powtoon62-1h9styy-300x165.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></p>

<p>5.  Paste the embed code into the Insert Embed code box and click <strong>Insert into post</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4754" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/embed61-19wt5k7.jpg" alt="Paste embed code" width="839" height="352" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/embed61-19wt5k7.jpg 839w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/embed61-19wt5k7-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></p>
<p>6.  When you have finished writing your post click <strong>Publish</strong>.</p>
<p>7.  You should see your video when you view the published post.</p>
<h3>Upload your own video</h3>
<p>You can also upload a video you&#8217;ve recorded to a post using the Add Media window.  The video must be recorded as a wmv, mp4, m4a or m4v file and can be no larger than 50 MB.  Larger videos need to be uploaded to a video sharing website like YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive and then embedded into your post.</p>
<p>Always record your videos by holding the phone or tablet in <strong>landscape mode with the home button on the right</strong>. This ensures that your video is the correct way up when you upload or edit it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4758" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-4758" src="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/pictures_ipad-1z4o9jd.png" alt="How to hold ipad" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/pictures_ipad-1z4o9jd.png 800w, https://teacherchallenge.edublogs.org/files/2017/05/pictures_ipad-1z4o9jd-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4758" class="wp-caption-text">Correct way to hold a phone or iPad when recording videos</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to edit your video you can use free video software like <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows7/products/features/movie-maker">Windows Movie Maker</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/creativity-apps/mac/">iMovie</a>.  Both allow you to combine photos and videos, with audio, to make professional looking movies.</p>
<p>Remember if your video is larger than 50 MB you will need to upload it to a video sharing website like YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive and then embed into your post.  For example, a video recorded on a phone that is longer than a minute would need to be uploaded to a video sharing website.</p>
<p>Remember to be Internet savvy.  Don’t share personal videos online. Be kind and compassionate. Don’t upload videos that could hurt someone else.</p>
